# rusty_life
Yet another Conway Game of Life implementation, in Rust.
This is obviously mainly an attempt at getting familiar with Rust syntax and way of thinking.

However, instead of being staisfied with things just working, I also want to focus on a data-oriented architecture instead of OOP, and safe and performant way to do the minimum calculations necessary, while having it readable.

Any help welcome, of course.
I've already looked at other implementations, and I am taking some inspirations. The goal for myself is to try a data-oriented design instead of OOP, and try some of that Rust fearless concurrency, first through CPU, then GPU.
