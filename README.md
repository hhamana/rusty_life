# rusty_life
Yet another Conway Game of Life implementation, in Rust.
This is obviously mainly an attempt at getting familiar with Rust syntax and way of thinking.

However, instead of being staisfied with things just working, I also want to focus on a data-oriented architecture instead of OOP, and safe and performant way to do the minimum calculations necessary, while having it readable.

Still not there, as of this 2019-08-08 commit, this does not compile.
any help welcome, of course.
I've already looked at other implementations, and I am taking some inspirations.
